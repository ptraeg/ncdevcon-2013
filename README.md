Example code is provided for:
* Native iOS
* Native Android
* PhoneGap 3 (iOS / Android)
* Appcelerator Titanium

*Caveat:* This session offered a brief overview of mobile development in 4 different technologies.  In all
cases the applications were built with essentially the default settings for each development tool.  In addition,
little if any effort was taken to style the app from the defaults provided for each environment.  As such
keep in mind the example code was presented as an introductory reference and should not be construed 
as "best practice" for any platform.
